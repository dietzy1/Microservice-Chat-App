//The bug could be related to when the websocket crashes unexpectedly and everything is cleaned up incorrectly
//for example some state change could be sent on the channel after the client is removed from the manager
//Maybe the solution is to make sure that the activity channel also is cleaned up like the rest of them

//There is currently a database
//The issue might be that I dont currently restrict myself to one concurrent reader and writer per connection
//So I need to look into if the client also is sending messages to the server
//And if that is the case then I need to create more channels to ensure that only the connection writer is allowed to write to the connection
