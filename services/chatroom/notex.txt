I think chatroom perhabs might need to be a seperate service that must work in conjunction with the message server

Should handle all the logic of the following:

type ChatRoom interface {
	CreateRoom(ctx context.Context)
	DeleteRoom(ctx context.Context)
	JoinRoom(ctx context.Context)
	LeaveRoom(ctx context.Context)
}

This also means it needs to perform multiple GRPC calls to the other services to update their State 

the data structure might look something like this

type ChatRoom struct {
	Users []User `json:"users" bson:"users"`
	Uuid  string `json:"uuid" bson:"uuid"`
    Icon Icon `json:"icon" bson:"icon"`
	Name  string `json:"name" bson:"name"`
	Owner string `json:"owner" bson:"owner"`
}

But it might be benefitial to add even more information to the ChatRoom struct
